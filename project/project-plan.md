# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
"The Interplay of Crop Plantation and Climate Change: Cultivating Understanding for a Sustainable Future"

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1.  "Which crops are most impactful on climate change, and which alternatives could be pursued for reduced environmental impact?"

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
In this data engineering project, the focus lies on unraveling the intricate relationship between crop production and climate change. By meticulously examining two pivotal datasets, the analysis aims to shed light on how agricultural practices influence and are influenced by climate dynamics. Through  data analysis techniques, the project endeavors to reveal insights into the environmental footprint of crop production, thus informing the development of sustainable agricultural policies. Ultimately, the goal is to equip stakeholders with the knowledge and tools necessary to cultivate a resilient and sustainable future amidst the challenges posed by climate change.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1:Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data
* Data URLs: can be downloaded through the Kaggle API in this project the data of countries are being used https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data?select=GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv
* Data Type: CSV
An extensive look of day to day change of climate in countries with their respective error rate. Some countries don't have their respective temperture data of 19th century which is compensated due to rich data set.

### Datasource2: Global Food & Agriculture Statistics
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unitednations/global-food-agriculture-statistics
* Data URL: Only the data regarding crops is being used https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unitednations/global-food-agriculture-statistics?select=fao_data_crops_data.csv
* Data Type: CSV
Quiet extensive data set of world UN data regarding 200 various crops of 200 different countries on yearly basis which makes it quiest comprehensive.
